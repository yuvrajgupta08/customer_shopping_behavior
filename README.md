Here is a more simplified but still professional version of the project description, broken into three clear paragraphs:

For this project, I built a data pipeline using Python and MySQL to analyze customer shopping habits. I used the Pandas library to clean the raw data, ensuring it was accurate and ready for analysis. This involved fixing missing information, such as review ratings, and standardizing all column names to a professional format that works seamlessly with database software.

I also performed feature engineering to turn basic data into meaningful categories. For example, I grouped customers by age and converted shopping frequencies into numeric values to better measure how often people buy products. I also streamlined the dataset by removing redundant information, making the entire analysis more efficient and focused on key business drivers.

Finally, I migrated the processed data into a MySQL Server using SQLAlchemy. This allowed me to run advanced SQL queries to identify high-value customers and top-performing products. This structured backend served as the direct source for an interactive Power BI dashboard, which transforms complex data into clear visuals that help businesses make smarter decisions.
