In this project, I engineered a sophisticated data pipeline using Python for initial processing and MySQL for robust relational data management. Leveraging the Pandas library, I executed a rigorous data-cleansing phase that included standardizing the schema into a recruiter-friendly snake_case format and addressing data gaps through intelligent imputation. Specifically, I utilized categorical median values to fill missing entries in the review ratings, ensuring the statistical integrity of the dataset was preserved for downstream analysis.

To unlock deeper business insights, I performed extensive feature engineering to transform raw data into actionable dimensions. I segmented the customer base into granular age demographics and converted qualitative purchase frequencies into numeric values, enabling a more quantitative approach to trend analysis. Furthermore, I optimized the data architecture by conducting a correlation analysis, which allowed me to remove redundant features and streamline the dataset for high-performance querying within the MySQL Server.

The final phase involved integrating the processed data into MySQL using SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL, where I authored complex scripts to extract key performance indicators (KPIs). This structured backend served as the foundation for an interactive Power BI dashboard, bridging the gap between raw data and executive-level decision-making. By automating the flow from Python-based transformation to SQL-driven analytics, I established a scalable workflow capable of identifying high-value customer segments and driving strategic retail growth.
